            <h3>Critique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This visualization is for an audience who wants to know more about where the Supreme Court justices stand on the ideology spectrum, especially now since the appointment of the new justice will affect all Americans in terms of future rulings.</li>
                <li>The visualization is based on two sources:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="nested">The Martin-Quinn score, established by two political scientists who have measured the ideological balance of the court, and its individual justices, going back to 1937.</li>
                        <li class="nested">Coney Barrett’s score is estimated by using a separate ideological measure for Appeals and Circuit court judges known as the Judicial Common Space (JCS) score.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The data got encoded into trend lines of each justice in terms of being conservative or liberal, with a median line in the middle indicating the trend of the overall ideology of the Supreme Court.</li>
                <li>The audiences are expected to compare trend lines and see how different (appointment) of justices has influenced the position of the Supreme Court as a whole overtime. Moreover, with the new vacancy opened by the passing of Justice RBG, the audience is shown the effect of the new appointment if it were to be done by President Trump (assuming the current top runner Amy Coney Barrett receives the nomination).</li>
                <li><span>5 Principles Evaluation: </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Truthful:</span> The sources of this visualization are listed as is. Since the Martin-Quinn score and the JCS are both trusted measures in this field, we should assume that the visualization is truthful.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Functional:</span> There is little to no chart junk in this visualization since the trend lines of past justices, who are not the main focus of this graph, are in lighter colors with no labels.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Beautiful:</span> This graph is pretty aesthetically pleasing, at least to our group members. The simple red and blue color pallet over black lines and a white background leave the viewer with a sense of clarity on the data.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Insightful:</span> It does provide a lot of information such as the overview of the current Supreme Court justices, the history of the Supreme Court’s ideology, and the impact the new nominee by Trump would have.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Enlightening:</span> This graph seems enlightening as it not only provides the immediate information the creator wants the audience to receive, but also surprising ones such as how RBG was appointed as a moderate justice by the Democrats but became more liberal in practice over her tenure on the court.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Critique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This visualization is for anyone who’s interested in learning about health benefits/risks of certain activities that many would easily ignore.</li>
                <li>The main message is to spread awareness about how to live a healthy life, though the audience is probably expected to make their own judgments among all the given factors.</li>
                <li><span>5 Principles Evaluation: </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Truthful:</span> The source data is given by the creator with citations to related scientific articles, so the truthfulness is promised to a certain extent. </li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Functional:</span> Although there are some graphics in this visualization to help with understanding, the overall functionality of it is good as there aren’t many irrelevant elements thrown into the graph.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Beautiful:</span> This is definitely one of the most visually appealing graphs among all our picks. It’s data presentation is simple overall, accompanied by small gender graphics and colors to aid the audience’s understanding of the message.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Insightful:</span> It’s a very insightful visualization because there’s not only the activities and corresponding effects on life expectancy, but also snippets of scientific information and tips to help make the experience more fun.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Enlightening:</span> It’s somewhat enlightening to the audience since many activities good/bad for one’s health are almost common sense to people, but still overlooked on a daily basis.</li>

            <h3>Critique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The audience of this visualization is the general public who is interested in learning about the biggest risk factors of catching coronavirus.</li>
                <li>The sources of it are media outlets specified on the bottom of the graph.</li>
                <li>The message is to make people aware of the risk factors and thus try to avoid these activities as much as possible during this pandemic.</li>
                <li>These activities are rated by various factors such as the ones listed in blue on the top left corner of the graph.</li>
                <li>The color and the size of the circles are great attributes to help convey the scale of risks of each activity, with needed explanations on ones that aren’t very intuitive.</li>
                <li><span>5 Principles Evaluation: </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Truthful:</span> Although the sources listed in the visualization are all fairly renowned, they are still media at the end of the day meaning there could still be bias or misinformation involved compared to scientific and government agencies.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Functional:</span> The graph is relatively functional in our opinion. Although there are both colors and graphics involved, both are beneficial to conveying the message. It would help for the audience to know which activities are riskier (e.g. those colored in red) and keep them in mind.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Beautiful:</span> The color scheme used in this graph is very fitting in that yellow and read are the best color for warning. The risk factors shown in blue are also very helpful because people can decide for themselves when in a situation not listed here.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Insightful:</span> It’s a very insightful visualization in that it provides the audience with risk factors that are less mentioned in the media such as friends sharing bathrooms and sharing condiments at a dine-in.</li>
                        <li class="nested"><span>Enlightening:</span> Through this visualization, we can not only know what to avoid during the pandemic and how to assess the risk level of all activities, but also reflect on the scope of COVID-19 and learn to appreciate these seemingly normal activities more.</li>
